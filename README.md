# 🚀 Alien Invasion Game – Pygame



## 📌 Description

This project is a classic *Alien Invasion* arcade-style game developed with Python and Pygame.

The goal of the game is simple:

> **Destroy all incoming aliens before they reach the base.**  
> If an alien touches the player, the game ends.  
> The player earns points for every alien destroyed.

This project is based on an existing codebase that I **improved**, adding new features, more polished gameplay, better visuals, and sound effects.
